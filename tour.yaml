    <strong>ETA queries</strong>

    To get ETAs for a bus stop, just send me the 5-digit bus stop code directly. There's no need to use a command like /eta.

    Give it a try now by sending me the text "02151".

    When you're done, come back to this message and hit the next button.

    <strong>Filtering ETA queries</strong>

    If you're only interested in ETAs for some of the buses at a bus stop, you can specify them as well.

    Try sending me the text "02151 36 106". You will only see ETAs for those two services.

    Use the next button to move on.
  navigation:
    - text: "Next: Refresh and resend"
      target: refresh_resend
refresh_resend:
  text: |-
    <strong>Refresh and resend</strong>

    The Refresh button on an ETA message updates the ETAs in the message. The time an ETA message was sent displayed by Telegram does not change, so refer to the last updated time in the message instead.

    The Resend button also updates ETAs, but sends a new message to the chat instead of editing the old message. Use it when you're worried about ETA messages getting lost in your message history.

    Try refreshing and resending the ETAs you previously requested.
  navigation:
    - text: "Next: Arriving bus details"
      target: arriving_bus_details
arriving_bus_details:
  text: |-
    <strong>Arriving bus details</strong>

    Switch to the arriving bus details view using the "Show arriving bus details" button. This shows additional information about each incoming bus: whether it is single or double decked, how full it is and whether it is wheelchair accessible.

    You can switch back to the summary view from the arriving bus details view using the "Show arriving bus summary" button.
  navigation:
    - text: "Next: Favourites"
      target: favourites
favourites:
  text: |-
    <strong>Favourites</strong>

    If you frequently make certain ETA queries, you can add them as favourites for quicker access. Use the /favourites command to manage your favourites.

    Take a moment now to issue the /favourites command and follow the instructions to add your first favourite if you'd like to find out how it works.
  navigation:
    - text: "Next: Inline queries"
      target: inline_queries
inline_queries:
  text: |-
    <strong>Inline queries</strong>

    You can send ETA messages to any chat, including this one, using Bus Eta Bot's inline mode. This lets you share ETAs with a friend or even a group.

    Give it a try now by starting a message with @BusEtaBot followed by a space. You should see a list of bus stops appear. Selecting any of them will send an ETA message to the current chat.

    If your location is available, the bus stops shown will be those nearest to you.
  navigation:
    - text: "Next: Searching for bus stops"
      target: searching_bus_stops
searching_bus_stops:
  text: |-
    <strong>Searching for bus stops</strong>

    You can also search for specific bus stops in your inline query. Just include the bus stop code, description or road name in your query and only bus stops which match will be returned.

    Try making an inline query for the same bus stop "02151". Then try again with the word "suntec".

    If you'd like, you can use the /tour command again anytime to go through it again.
